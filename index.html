                    <p>Welcome to the Larkin Community Hospital website, and thank you for taking the time to learn
                        about our hospital.
                        Our dedicated team of health care professionals is committed to provide a high-quality service
                        and making your
                        stay as comfortable and pleasant as possible. <a href="#">read more</a></p>
                    <div class="welcome-read-more-text">
                        <p> At Larkin Community Hospital, we have been serving the health care needs of South Miami,
                            Hialeah, and the
                            surrounding communities for more than 35 years. We take pride in the continuing tradition of
                            caring and we
                            remain dedicated to providing excellent medical care with the personal touch and convenience
                            that only a
                            community hospital can offer.

                            We hope you can find health, comfort, and peace of mind as a result of your stay with us. At
                            our hospital,
                            we provide comprehensive health care to the individual using the biopsychosocial model of
                            patient care in
                            the context of the family and the community. The Larkin medical staff is a faithful advocate
                            of the genuine
                            concept of optimal health: “A state of vitality to maintain enjoyment and satisfaction with
                            life and not
                            just the absence of disease”. If there is anything we can do to make your stay more
                            comfortable, please do
                            not hesitate to let our staff know. If at any time you do not feel you are being treated in
                            a fair and
                            concerned manner, please ask to speak with a representative from patient relations, or our
                            nursing
                            supervisor who is in the hospital 24 hours a day.

                            Please take some time to acquaint yourself with our hospitals and the services available to
                            you. We consider
                            this information a requisite to the healing process.

                            At Larkin Community Hospital we consider you, our customer, a valuable partner in our
                            healthcare team. Your
                            input is invaluable to us; we would appreciate your comments, complaints or suggestions.
                            Please feel free to
                            share your opinions with our representatives, or you may also forward your comments to the
