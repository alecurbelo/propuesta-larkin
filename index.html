    <section id="Welcome">
        <p>Welcome to the Larkin Community Hospital website, and thank you for taking the time to learn about our hospital. Our dedicated team of health care professionals is committed to provide a high-quality service and making your stay as comfortable and pleasant as possible.</p>
<div>
           <p> At Larkin Community Hospital, we have been serving the health care needs of South Miami, Hialeah, and the surrounding communities for more than 35 years. We take pride in the continuing tradition of caring and we remain dedicated to providing excellent medical care with the personal touch and convenience that only a community hospital can offer.
            
            We hope you can find health, comfort, and peace of mind as a result of your stay with us. At our hospital, we provide comprehensive health care to the individual using the biopsychosocial model of patient care in the context of the family and the community. The Larkin medical staff is a faithful advocate of the genuine concept of optimal health: “A state of vitality to maintain enjoyment and satisfaction with life and not just the absence of disease”. If there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable, please do not hesitate to let our staff know. If at any time you do not feel you are being treated in a fair and concerned manner, please ask to speak with a representative from patient relations, or our nursing supervisor who is in the hospital 24 hours a day.
            
            Please take some time to acquaint yourself with our hospitals and the services available to you. We consider this information a requisite to the healing process.
            
            At Larkin Community Hospital we consider you, our customer, a valuable partner in our healthcare team. Your input is invaluable to us; we would appreciate your comments, complaints or suggestions. Please feel free to share your opinions with our representatives, or you may also forward your comments to the Administration Department. We treat all such information with the utmost concern for confidentiality.
            
            Sincerely,</p></div>
