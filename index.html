                <p>Welcome to the Larkin Community Hospital website, and thank you for taking the time to learn about our hospital.
                    Our dedicated team of health care professionals is committed to provide a high-quality service and making your
                    stay as comfortable and pleasant as possible.</p>
                <div class="welcome-read-more-text">
                    <p> At Larkin Community Hospital, we have been serving the health care needs of South Miami, Hialeah, and the
                        surrounding communities for more than 35 years. We take pride in the continuing tradition of caring and we
                        remain dedicated to providing excellent medical care with the personal touch and convenience that only a
                        community hospital can offer.

                        We hope you can find health, comfort, and peace of mind as a result of your stay with us. At our hospital,
                        we provide comprehensive health care to the individual using the biopsychosocial model of patient care in
                        the context of the family and the community. The Larkin medical staff is a faithful advocate of the genuine
                        concept of optimal health: “A state of vitality to maintain enjoyment and satisfaction with life and not
                        just the absence of disease”. If there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable, please do
                        not hesitate to let our staff know. If at any time you do not feel you are being treated in a fair and
                        concerned manner, please ask to speak with a representative from patient relations, or our nursing
                        supervisor who is in the hospital 24 hours a day.

                        Please take some time to acquaint yourself with our hospitals and the services available to you. We consider
                        this information a requisite to the healing process.

                        At Larkin Community Hospital we consider you, our customer, a valuable partner in our healthcare team. Your
                        input is invaluable to us; we would appreciate your comments, complaints or suggestions. Please feel free to
                        share your opinions with our representatives, or you may also forward your comments to the Administration
                        Department. We treat all such information with the utmost concern for confidentiality.

                        Sincerely,</p></div>
